# EGit Jenkins Pipelines

This repository contains the EGit Jenkins pipeline library.

For general information about Jenkins pipeline shared libraries see the [Jenkins documentation](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/).

Jenkins pipelines are written in Groovy; for development in Eclipse it may help to install the [Groovy Development Tools](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/groovy-development-tools). Be aware, though, that GDT patches the JDT Java compiler; a particular version of GDT thus works only with a particular version of JDT. If you use an Eclipse I-build (nightly development build for the next release), GDT will fail to install.

The library is intended to be used for the [Jenkins builds](https://ci.eclipse.org/egit/) of the egit/egit and the egit/egit-github repositories.

It provides several kinds of general pipelines that can be configured:

* `verifyBuild` is a simple pipeline that builds and runs the tests for a Gerrit patch set.
* `productBuild` is intended to be run when a Gerrit patch set is submitted and builds a full distribution (nightly or stable build).

`uiNode` encapsulates the general Jenkins slave setup to run a build including UI tests on a JIRO node.

Directory `src` contains auxiliary Groovy classes encapsulating generally useful operations.
