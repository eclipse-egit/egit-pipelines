Compiler and ran with Java 17, generated class have version 55.0 (Java 11).\n\nChanges:\n* Set temurin-jdk17-latest by default to run the build (can be overridden via config \u0027jdk\u0027).\n* pass the GPG passphrase via an environment variable, not via the command line (less risk of it getting exposed in a build log, though Jenkins\u0027 masking seems to be fairly clever).\n* introduce a config flag \"gpg\" so that we can switch it on or off. (On for EGit by default.)\n",
